# MilkMate Admin Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

All issues have been resolved. The admin dashboard is now complete and fully operational with professional MERN-stack level features.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Main Issue Resolved
**Problem:** The `DashboardLayout.jsx` component had an outdated interface that only accepted a pre-built `sidebar` prop, but the new `AdminDashboard` component needed to pass `navigationItems`, `currentView`, and other dynamic props.

**Solution:** Updated `DashboardLayout.jsx` to support BOTH interfaces:
- **Legacy mode:** Accepts pre-built `sidebar` ReactNode (used by Customer, Provider, Partner dashboards)
- **Modern mode:** Accepts `navigationItems` array and builds sidebar dynamically (used by Admin dashboard)
